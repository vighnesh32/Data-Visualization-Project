#### Data Information

The main dataset was selected from London Datastore [10]. This dataset contains the 203578 rows × 39 columns representing various incidents happened related London Fire Brigade between 1st January 2019 to 31st March 2022. The main data was further altered for the year 2021 and the dataset processing is done in python language.

#### 1. Insight one
The primary objective of the first research question is to identify trends that emerged as a result of the numerous London Fire Brigade related events that occurred at various properties in 2021. The first research question is divided in to three visualization. The first visualization depicts the pattern of incidents that occurred at various properties each hour during the year 2021 which makes it a temporal visualization. As it can be observed in the first visualization of the first research question, the number of occurrences during the night hours is lower than the number of events during the day hours. The number of occurrences occurred between 3000 and 4000 at midnight, with the majority of them occurring in dwellings. Then, as the night progresses, the number of instances begins to decline, demonstrating the downward trend. Following the completion of the declining trend at 5 a.m., the trend began to reverse at 6 a.m., suggesting that the number of occurrences began to increase. From 9 a.m. to 15 p.m., a total of 4000 to 6000 activities took place. After having gone slightly beyond the 6000 mark in the afternoon, the number of occurrences started to show signs of a downward trend once again in the evening.The second visualization of the first research question illustrates the number of occurrences that occurred at different properties each month in 2021 making it a temporal visualization. It can be observed in the second visualization, the number of events reported from January to March fluctuates between 6000 and 8000, with the bulk of incidents occurring in dwellings followed by incidents occurring in non-residential properties. Following a period of sideways movement, the number of occurrences surged from April to June, with estimates ranging between 8000 to 10,000, indicating an increasing trend. The month of July represents a definite peak in the number of events, which fell just short of the 12000 mark. This rise was brought about by an increase in the number of occurrences occurring in the residences. The number of events decreased in the months of August and September, and the number of incidents grew in the months of October and December, initially increasing in the month of October and then beginning to reduce in the months of November and December. The third visualization of the first research question shows the occurrences that occurred at various properties on different days of the week during the year 2021 which is result of temporal visualization. As it can be observed, the number of incidents on Monday was close to 16000, with the majority of them occurring in residences, followed by non-residential buildings, while the number of events occurring at rest sites remained almost unchanged. On Tuesday, the instances were nearly identical to those that occurred on Monday. On Wednesday, the number of events decreased marginally, while the number remained stable on Thursday as compared to Wednesday. When compared to Thursday, the number of events surged on Friday, reaching 16000 for the first time. The number of instances reduced even more on Saturday and Sunday.

#### 2. Insight two
The second research question key aim is to ascertain which London fire group was the busiest and to determine the response patterns of different London Fire Brigade incident groups. For the second research question, one visualization is explored, which represents the performance of the different incident groups on a monthly basis, which is a coxcomb graphical visualization. As can be seen in January, the highest number of events occurred in the false alarm category. Following the false alarm group, the special service group is the most often deployed. Fire occurrences for the month of January are rare in comparison to other types of incidents, the fire incident group was called less as compared to the other two groups. In February the fire incidents increased as compare to January therefore the fire group was utilized a bit more than January. In February, the utilization of the false alarm and special service category was almost identical to that of January. The number of fire-related events rose, as seen in the visualization, in March and April, necessitating a greater allocation of resources for the fire group than in February. As for false alarms and special service groups, the demand for these groups was almost identical to the demand in February. When compared to March and April, the number of calls for the special service group grew, while the number of fire incidents fell, but the need for the false alarm group only slightly increased. In June and July, demand for special service group grew even further, while demand for the other two groups remained unchanged for June and July. When compared to previous months, in August and September the demand for the false alarm and fire group remained practically the same, but the demand for the special service group fell. All of the groups' demand in October appears to be similar to the groups demand in September. In November, the demand for fire group rose somewhat, before decreasing in December. In November and December, demand for special group and false alarm group was slightly lower than in October.

#### 3. Insight three 
The third research question is primarily concerned with establishing a relationship between the percentage of notional cost per borough, the percentage of pumps employed for various purposes within each borough, and the percentage of time each pump is used. Three visuals have been assigned to the third research question. The first visualization for the third research question illustrates the percentage of the hypothetical cost per borough in 2021, which is a geospatial representation. Croydon, Southwark, Camden, Tower Hamlets, and Westminster each receive a percentage of the notional cost ranging from 4 percent to slightly more than 6.5 percent, as can be seen in visualisation  The notional cost percentage ranges between 3 percent and just below 4 percent in the boroughs of Islington and Wandsworth, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey and Enfield, Brent, Lewisham and Ealing, Barnet, Hackney and Kensington and Chelsea as well as the boroughs of Lambeth and Newham. The boroughs of Kingston upon Thames, Merton, Richmond upon Thames, Harrow, Sutton, Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Havering, Bexley, Hounslow, Bromley, Hillingdon, Greenwich, and Waltham Forest all have rates ranging from 1 percent to just around 3 percent of the population. When compared to other boroughs, the percentage of the notional cost allotted to the City of London is the smallest, accounting for less than 1 percent of the total. The second visualization for the third research question depicts the percentage of pumps used in each borough in 2021 to deal with the incidents which is geospatial. As seen in the visualization the pumps used in the borough of Westminster have the highest percentage which is close to 7.5 percent. The percentage of the pumps ranges between 3% to just above 4.5% for the boroughs of Brent, Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Islington, Wandsworth, Kensington and Chelsea, Newham, Barnet, Lewisham, Hackney, Lambeth, Croydon, Southwark, Camden and Tower Hamlets respectively. Kingston upon Thames, Merton, Richmond upon Thames, Sutton, Harrow, Barking and Dagenham, Bexley, Havering, Redbridge, Hounslow, Bromley, Waltham Forest, Hillingdon, Greenwich, Enfield, Haringey are the boroughs in which the percentage of the pumps used between the range of 1 percent to just around 3 percent. For this visualization City of London have the lowest percentage of pumps used as compare to others. The third visualization for the third research question depicts the percentage of time spend by pumps in each borough in 2021 which is a geospatial representation. As seen the percent of time spend by pumps in borough of Westminster is the highest which is just above 6.5 percent. The percentage of time spend by pumps in the boroughs of Islington, Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth, Haringey, Enfield, Brent, Lewisham, Ealing, Barnet, Hackney, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Newham, Croydon, Southwark, Camden and Tower Hamlets are between 3% to just above 4% respectively. For the boroughs of Kingston upon Thames, Merton, Richmond upon Thames, Harrow, Sutton, Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Havering, Bexley, Hounslow, Bromley, Hillingdon, Greenwich, Waltham Forest have the range between 1 percent to just around 3 percent and the percentage of the time spend by the pumps in the borough of City of London is below 1 percent which is the lowest as compare to others. The three visualizations of the third research question seem to be related to each other as the percentage of notional cost, percentage of the pumps used and the time spend pumps are close to each other.

#### 1. Choice one
****Data Representation****

The data for first research question was available in multidimensional tables. For stacked bar charts multidimensional tables needs one quantitative attribute and two categorical key attributes [1]. In the data for the first research question, the quantitative characteristic is the number of incidents, and the two categorical key qualities are the hour (temporal) and properties. The quantitative variable for the second visualisation of the first research question is the number of incidents, whereas the two categorical key attributes are month (temporal) and properties. The quantitative attribute for the third visualization of the first research question is the number of instances, whereas the two categorical key elements are day(temporal) and properties.

The data for second research question is also present in the multidimensional tables. This data can be represented in bar charts or stacked bar chart but for this visualization the coxcomb is considered. As bar chart data is represented in a coxcomb [2]. For the visualization the coxcomb chart consists of categorical key attributes such as month(temporal), Fire alarm, Fire and Special Service.

The data for third research question is represented in a choropleth map. A choropleth map displays quantitative values for distinct, definable spatial regions on a map [3]. The quantitative data for the third research question is shown as a percentage notional cost, and the spatial regions are represented by boroughs in the first visualization. The quantitative data for the third research question is shown as a percentage of pumps, while the spatial regions are represented by boroughs. The third visualization of the third study question displays quantitative data as a percentage of the hour and spatial regions as boroughs.

#### 2. Choice two
****Annotation****
Direct value labelling can become very cluttered when there are many parts or stacks and you are comparing several different major categories [3]. Because there are no significant categories accessible, the labelling for the initial visualization of the first research question is minimal. On the x-axis, the hour is shown by a number between 0 and 23, and on the y-axis, the number of incidents is indicated by a number between 0 and 7000. For the second visualisation of the first research question, the labelling has remained uncluttered due to the absence of major categories. The x-axis is month-based and ranges from 1 to 12, while the y-axis is incident-based and ranges from 0 to 12000. Due to the absence of main categories, the third visualization of the first research question is uncluttered. The x-axis depicts the days from Monday to Sunday, while the y-axis depicts the number of events, which ranges from 0 to 18000.

In the visualization for the second research question the three variables of incident groups are considered which forms the three rate variables [4]. Also the temporal variables are used which depicts the performance of the incident groups. The temporal variables are ranging from January to December.

Directly labelling the regional areas with geographical details and the value they hold is likely to lead to too much clutter [3]. The first, second, and third visualizations for the third research question do not have annotations; instead, hovering reveals the names of the boroughs, which are categorical variables. To reduce clutter and any overlapping of annotations, the variable names are concealed.

#### 3.  Choice three
****Colour****

If you are representing categorical ordinal data, colour can be astutely deployed to give a senseof the general balance of values within the whole, but this will only work if their sorting arrangement within the stack is logically applied [3]. For the first, second, and third visualisations of the first research question, the colour representing the various properties is balanced and rationally arranged within the stack. Each subcomponent is coloured according to the same key that is used to determine the vertical ordering [1]. Each property category acts as a subcomponent in the first, second, and third visualizations of the first research question, and is coloured according to the number of incidences.

The colour palette for the visualization of the second research question has allotted three different colours which makes that colour palette qualitative. In a qualitative palette, the colours assigned to each group need to be distinct. As a rule of thumb, you should try to limit the maximum palette size to 10 or fewer colours [5].

For the first, second, and third visualizations of the third research question, legends are inserted at the top right of the map, next to the map, which clearly shows the colour scales. Legends explaining the colour scales should ideally be placed as close to the map display as possible [3]. Do not include any unnecessary geographical details that add no value to the spatial orientation or interpretation and clutter the display (e.g. roads, building structures) [3]. Only boroughs name using hovering method was displayed on the map for the first, second, and third visualizations of the third research question due to the possibility of overlapping or crowding.

##### 1.  Evaluation one
###### Strengths and weaknesses for visualizations of first research question
###### Strengths-
1. Each component of the bar is separately stacked, so that the full bar height shows the value for the combination of all items in the stack [1]. For all the visualizations of the first research question the components of the bar which are number of incidents happened are separately stacked which depicts the entire bar height.
2. The stacked bar chart used to represent all the visualizations of first research question is showing the total of all incidents happened as well as it is depicting the individual incidents total which took place.
###### Weaknesses-
1. The number of categories in the key attribute distributed across the main axis, but it is more limited for the key used to stack the subcomponents [1]. For the all the visualizations of the first research questions Road Vehicle, Rail Vehicle, Outdoor Structure, Other Residential, Non residential, Dwelling, Boat and Aircraft are the subcomponents which are limited.
2. For the second visualization of the first research question the viewer face problem while understanding the x-axis because it is represented as the range of months from 1 to 12.

##### 2.  Evaluation two
###### Strengths and weaknesses for visualization of second research question
###### Strengths-
1. Seasonal patterns can be visible in coxcomb plot [6]. The seasonal patterns of how the various incident groups are utilized are seen from the coxcomb chart represented for the visualization of the second research question. 
2. The viewer can easily see in visualization for the second research question that the monthly utilization of the different incident groups for the various incidents caused.
###### Weaknesses-
1. When viewer will see the visualization that person will be confused because the months are not continuous, as seen in the visualization the month after the January in the chart is depicting October. 

##### 3.  Evaluation three
###### Strengths and weaknesses for visualizations of third research question
###### Strengths-

1. For all the visualizations the of the third research question the quantitative measures are directly related with the spatial regions which are boroughs of London. The Choropleth maps should only be used when the quantitative measure is directly associated with and continuously relevant across the spatial region on which it will be displayed [3].

2.  The viewer can easily hover over all the choropleth maps and identify the relationship between the percentage of notional cost, percentage of pump used and the percentage of time spend by the pumps.

###### Weaknesses-

1. The viewer will be confused as only one legend is provided for all the visualizations which is located top right of the first visualization of the third research question.

2. There is possibility that the viewer might think the annotations on the maps are missing which has been removed to avoid overlapping and cluttering.
